 ## Introduction
Simply put, itâ€™s a version control repository that contains multiple projects or applications within a single repository.
A monorepo is a single, centralized storage repository for all your application and microservice code. Unlike traditional, decentralized version control strategies where each project or service has its own repository, a monorepo encompasses the entire codebase in one repository. This includes libraries, services, and sometimes even datasets and configuration files.

## Why
Monorepos offer improved visibility, allowing teams to better communicate and collaborate. In a large team, this is especially beneficial. Developers can see the entire codebase, understand the context of their work better, and make cross-project changes effortlessly.

## Features 
 * Manageable
 1.  Source code sharing
 2.  Consistent tooling
 3. Code generation
 4. Project constraints and visibility
* Understandable
 1.  Workspace analysis
 2.  Dependency graph visualization
* Fast
 1. Local computation caching
 2. Local task orchestration
 3. Distributed computation caching
 4. Distributed task execution
 5. Transparent remote execution
 6. Detecting Affected projects/package

## Advantages 
- Code Reusability: Monorepos encourage code reusability by allowing multiple projects to share common code, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.
- Easier Collaboration: With all code in one place, collaboration becomes seamless. Developers can access and modify different projects without having to switch repositories.
- Streamlined Dependency Management: Managing dependencies is simplified, as all projects share a single package manager and version control system.
- Atomic Commits and Releases: Monorepos enable atomic commits and releases, ensuring that changes across multiple projects are always in sync.
- Improved Testing: Comprehensive testing becomes easier, as you can run tests across all projects simultaneously, ensuring better code quality.

## Diadvantages / Challenges
- Complexity: Monorepos can become complex as the codebase grows, making it challenging to navigate and understand.
- Slower Cloning: Initial repository cloning can be time-consuming, especially for new developers joining the team.
- Tooling Overhead: Specialized tooling is often required for managing monorepos, which can add complexity to your development workflow.
- Risk of Over-Engineering: There is a risk of over-engineering by trying to fit everything into a monorepo, even when it might not be the best solution for certain projects.
