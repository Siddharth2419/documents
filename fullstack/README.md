## Introduction

Full Stack Development is the process of creating a complete web application that includes front-end, back-end, and database management. 
The front end deals with the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the web application. I
t is responsible for the visual representation of the application and how it interacts with users. Back-end development is responsible for server-side programming, which includes business logic, data access, and security. Finally, database management is responsible for storing, accessing, and managing data for the application.

- **Frontend**: The user interface of the application.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic and data processing.
- **Database**: The data storage system.

### Front-end development: 
Front-end development deals with the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the web application. It is responsible for creating a visual representation of the application and how it interacts with users. Front-end developers use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the web application's user interface.

### Back-end development: 
Back-end development is responsible for server-side programming, which includes business logic, data access, and security. Back-end developers use programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP to develop the back-end of the web application.

### Database management: 
Database management is responsible for storing, accessing, and managing data for the application. It deals with the creation, maintenance, and optimization of databases. Database management is done using tools like MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.
