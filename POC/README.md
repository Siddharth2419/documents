# Mono-Repo Proof of Concept

***

## Pre-requisites
Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
Git: A version control system for managing your repository.

## Purpose
The purpose of this POC is to demonstrate how to set up a monorepo using Lerna for managing multiple JavaScript/TypeScript projects within a single repository. This setup will show how to organize projects, manage dependencies, and use Lerna to bootstrap and manage the monorepo.

## System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications        | Minimum Recommendation           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| RAM      | At least 4GB |
| Storage      | SSD recommended     |
| CPU | Modern multi-core processor     |

 ### System Requirements
  Operating System: Any OS that supports Node.js and npm (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
  Node.js: Version 12 or higher.
  npm: Version 6 or higher.

## Dependencies
Lerna: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
Yarn (optional): Another package manager for JavaScript. While Lerna works with npm, Yarn is often preferred for better performance and features.
## Monorepo tools
